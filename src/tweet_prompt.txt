Take the following description of a project on Vancouver's public consultation website and summarize it for a tweet. Do not use hashtags. Be succinct; only include the most important information. Don't mention that the project is pending approval; the reader will know. If it's a rezoning application, preface the tweet with "Rezoning application". If it's a development application, preface it with "Development application:" If it's something unexpected, summarize it succinctly however you like.
