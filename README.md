# RezoningScraper

A small project written for [Abundant Housing Vancouver](http://www.abundanthousingvancouver.com).

Scrapes the City of Vancouver's website for rezoning and development applications, then notifies people of any changes via Slack. It's a simple standalone app using SQLite as a data store, runs on any major OS. Just copy the app (1 file, no dependencies) to a server and run it with a cron job, no further steps needed.

## To Do

- [ ] GitHub Actions for build+test
- [ ] GitHub Action to automatically publish trimmed executables as a release
- [x] `--dry-run` flag that doesn't update the local DB
- [x] Add retries to the token fetching. It times out fairly often
- [x] Some kind of development cache thingy. The API is slowwwww and that makes iterative development painful
- [ ] Discord integration?
- [ ] Twitter integration?
- [ ] Display more project fields?
- [ ] [This is rough](https://github.com/rgwood/RezoningScraper/blob/ca38460e6ffbd177ef842b0362ff3449737bf3a5/RezoningScraper/TokenHelper.cs#L54-L60), there's gotta be a better way to query JSON
- [ ] Consider archiving old versions of projects
- [ ] Hook up to Sentry for error reporting
- [ ] Script deployment (just rsync and cron lol) to a remote server
- [x] Strip line breaks from project titles - CoV does that sometimes and it breaks the Slack link format.
- [x] Consider excluding `published -> archived` state transitions from Slack. Lots of noise, not particularly useful
