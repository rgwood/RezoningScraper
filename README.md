# RezoningScraper

A small project written for [Abundant Housing Vancouver](http://www.abundanthousingvancouver.com).

Scrapes the City of Vancouver's website for rezoning and development applications, then notifies people of any changes via Slack. It's a simple standalone app using SQLite as a data store, runs on any major OS. Just copy the app (1 file, no dependencies) to a server and run it with a cron job, no further steps needed.

## To Do

- [ ] Figure out better error handling. Ideally we'd put messages on a queue to be processed.
  - [ ] Have multiple queues; one for Slack things, one for Bluesky
  - [ ] Would be cool to make this a library. Give it a SQLite DB and let it go wild. But maybe start small and pull it into a library later
  - [ ] Need dead letter queues too
  - [ ] Backed by a MessageQueue table and a DeadLetterQueue table
  - [ ] What should API look like? I think give it a table name and make it generic over the types of messages expected
    - [ ] dequeue<T>(table_name: string) -> Result<Option<T>>
      - or similar (may want to return a Message<T> that provides extra data)
- [ ] Hook up to Sentry for error reporting
- [ ] Add option to post to Bluesky
