# RezoningScraper

A small project written for [Abundant Housing Vancouver](http://www.abundanthousingvancouver.com).

Scrapes the City of Vancouver's website for rezoning and development applications, then notifies people of any changes via Slack. It's a simple standalone app using SQLite as a data store, runs on any major OS. Just copy the app (1 file, no dependencies) to a server and run it with a cron job, no further steps needed.

## To Do

- [x] Figure out better error handling. Ideally we'd put messages on a queue to be processed.
- [ ] Set up Datadog for error reporting. Just tail the logs for now? Or use https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-api-client-rust?tab=readme-ov-file
- [x] Add option to post to Bluesky
